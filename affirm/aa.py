'''
Given an input list of names, for each name, find the shortest substring that only appears in that name.

Example:

Input: ["cheapair", "cheapoair", "peloton", "pelican"]
Output:
"cheapair": "pa"  // every other 1-2 length substring overlaps with cheapoair
"cheapoair": "po" // "oa" would also be acceptable
"pelican": "ca"   // "li", "ic", or "an" would also be acceptable
"peloton": "t"    // this single letter doesn't occur in any other string
