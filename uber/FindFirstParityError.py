'''
An array is considered to follow an alternating parity pattern if it does not contain 
two consecutive integers of the same parity. 
In other words, all consecutive integers in the array will never be two even numbers nor two odd numbers.

Given an array of non-negative integers, determine whether there are elements which break the alternating parity pattern. 
Return the index of the first element where the alternating parity pattern breaks, 
or -1 if there are no such elements.

不需要提供最优解，但需要提供一个在时间上可行的解决方案。
